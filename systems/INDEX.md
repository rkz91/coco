# System Bundles Index

Auto-generated. Run `python3 scripts/build-index.py` to refresh.

Bundles under `systems/` are opt-in via `install.sh --systems <name>`. Directories under `adapters/` ship with their adapter instead and are not selectable with that flag.

> **Advertised as a bundle but installs no artifacts:** `learning`, `team`. These directories hold documentation only, so passing them to `--systems` has no effect.
